üåê This project showcases my experience with **Terraform** to automate the creation of AWS infrastructure. By leveraging Terraform, I was able to efficiently set up key **AWS** resources like **VPCs**, **EC2 instances**, **route tables**, **subnets**, **security groups**, and **load balancers**.

## Project Highlights

- **Automated Deployment**: Utilized Terraform to automate the setup of AWS resources, making the infrastructure provisioning process seamless and repeatable.
- **Load Balancer Configuration**: Launched two web servers and tested how the **Load Balancer** distributes traffic between them, ensuring optimal resource utilization and high availability.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: This project reinforced my skills in **IaC** and provided a deeper understanding of load balancing in **AWS**.

## Technologies Used

- **Terraform**
- **AWS EC2**
- **AWS VPC**
- **AWS Load Balancer**

## Key Learnings

- Enhanced my ability to automate AWS infrastructure setup using Terraform.
- Gained hands-on experience with **IaC** practices.
- Developed a better understanding of traffic management through load balancing.
